### Hi there 👋
I'm a budding software engineer with a bachelor's degree in electronics and communication. I am a student at SRH University Berlin pursuing a Master's in Artificial Intelligence and big data. I desire to work on image processing applications with AI and am currently building knowledge in cloud services (AWS&Azure).
